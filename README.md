Just a little bash script to quickly create a pre-defined folder structure.

Made for german-speaking, Linux-using filmmakers who want to use the same structure for their projects as I do. And for everyone who knows enough bash to modify it to their own needs.

May or may not be made a little more user-friendly in the future.

Inspired by Digital Rebellion's software [Post Haste](https://www.digitalrebellion.com/posthaste/) for Windows / Mac.
